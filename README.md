# Nina's farm - Game developed for the Java class, Semester 7, 2024

Nina's Farm is a simple 2D game where you control one character while trying to escape from another. If both characters collide, it's game over!

# Description

Single-Level Gameplay: This is an initial, single-level experience designed to be straightforward and fun.

_Two Characters:_
A white character (the "runner") who tries to evade the chaser.
A gray character (the "chaser") who attempts to catch the white one.
Game Over Condition: If the white and gray characters touch, the game immediately ends. 

_Controls:_
White Character (Runner): Move using the arrow keys (↑, ↓, ←, →).
Gray Character (Chaser): Move using W, A, S, D keys.

Try to keep the white character away from the gray one for as long as possible!
